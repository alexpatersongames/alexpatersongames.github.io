				<p>Get ready for a journey across England like you've never been on before. With just a few pounds in your wallet and your grandpa's slightly unreliable narrowboat
				to travel on, you must make it to the other end of the canal. It's a long journey when your top speed is 8 miles per hour, so you've got to be creative in order
				to stay afloat.</p>
