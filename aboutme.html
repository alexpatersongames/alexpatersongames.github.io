				<p>The building site in Bulera, Uganda.</p>

			<p>Hi, I'm Alex Paterson, if you haven't guessed by the name of the site. As well as being an amateur game developer, I'm also a Computer Information Systems student
			at Bangor University. I'm originally from Lancashire.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Away from anything IT related, I love hill walking and kayaking. I'm also a Duke of Edinburgh's Award Assessor and National Small-bore Rifle Association instructor.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I'm an Explorer Scout leader at Stanhope ESU and DeMon ESU. I've been in Scouting since I was 6 or 7, and had the oppurtunity to go on some amazing adventures.
			The biggest, best one (so far) was to Bulera in Uganda over summer 2019. We built a chicken farm to help fund a struggling school. I'm currently working on plans
			to go back (hopefully in 2022) and install computers at the school.</p>
