				<h2>The Making of Sheepocalypse: Sheep Arena</h2>
				<p>Sheepocalypse: Sheep Arena was developed for a sixth form project. It was my first game to get released to the public and my first succesful attempt at making an FPS
				game. It took me 3 months to create, starting in September 2018 and the first build being published to <a href = "https://itch.io">itch.io</a> on 30th December 2018.
				Originally, it would have been a far longer game with a short campaign, but due to time constraints, I had to cut it with only 1 level being designed. From there, I
				developed the game to be a wave-based arena combat game using an arcade-style high score system.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>The rest of the game's content evolved as well - the player character went from a cyborg to a normal human, the gun went through 3 iterations (at one point having
				bouncy grenades like the ones in Quake) and the game's art style changed from "realistic" to cartoonish. There would also have been more sheep variants, but only one
				ever had a model - the Lightning Sheep, which had blue eyes rather than red and zapped the player with electricty from a distance rather than headbutting them. At one
				stage, Sheepocalypse would have had driveable veichle sections, and I had made a working Humvee by the time I finished Sheep Arena. A lot of this content is still
				included in the final Sheepocalypse: Sheep Arena Unity project, but I'm not sure if they got bundled into the final executable.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>In spring 2020, I started work on a Sheepocalypse sequel (titled "Sheepocalypse" as it was again intended to be a campaign based game). It would have ran on Windows
				10 and Xbox One. Unlike Sheepocalypse: Sheep Arena, it had more than 1 weapon, and at the point of me scrapping the idea, they had fully animated charchter arms and
				firing effects. Sadly, I couldn't find any images of these, only ones from very very early in development. It had working sheep AI and also a semi-functional Lightning
				Sheep, but they looked very similar to their Sheep Arena versions but with smaller heads.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>I've been looking through my computer to try and find some screenshots showing the evolution of Sheepocalypse, the cut content and bits of the sequel. I hope they're
				interesting and show you what I hoped Sheepocalypse could be. All is not lost though, as I've packaged up the Xbox One build of the unfinished sequel for you to play.
				It can be installed on Developer Mode Windows 10 PCs as well as Developer Mode consoles, and can be downloaded from
				<a href = "downloads/Sheepocalypse-Xbox-Unreleased.7z">here</a>.</p>
